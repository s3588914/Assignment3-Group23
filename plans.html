											<h4>What will our project do?</h4>
										<p>	Our project idea is to preload a Raspberry Pi with simple programmable games. 
											This game device is marketed towards primary school children, as programming and coding in primary schools is becoming increasingly popular and essential in today's educational society.
										<br />
											This type of device is great for those with little-to-no knowledge on programming, because the games available will be entertaining and easy to manipulate as the game codes will be annotated, making it easier for users to modify. 
											This device would serve well in schools, and has many applications.
										 	 One example would be a fantastic group project or assignment for kids to explore coding.
										<br />
											Our objective is to create a straightforward device to use, so instructors can understand and help kids get started quickly and easily - we want this to be as simple as “Plug and Play”. 
											Built on a Raspberry Pi, it is extremely portable. All the user needs is a monitor with HDMI.
										<br />
											There will be an included controller that will be very customisable in the sense that users could add and map different buttons and controls to perform different actions in the games. 
											This helps teach interfacing software and hardware. 
										</p>

											<h4>How we will do it?</h4>
										
										<p>	Using a game programming framework, we will design and develop at least one working game to deploy to the Raspberry Pi, which will interface with an external controller.
											This is dependent on obtaining a Raspberry Pi model, building a working controller (including finding a way to interface the controller to the Pi successfully).
											This also relies on learning enough about the previously mentioned game framework to commence programming a simple game.
										</p>
										
											<h4>How far we have gotten with developing any features or outcomes from our project?</h4>

										<p>	At this point in time, we have chosen a game library called Phaser, which is an HTML5/JS framework to assist in creating browser-based games. Using this language, we developed a basic “brick” game which involves using a paddle to deflect a ball to knock out all the “bricks” above.
										<br/ >
										We have also obtained a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+, and the parts required to build a basic controller that consists of a joystick and 2 buttons. We installed Raspbian on the Pi as the base OS, and also constructed a basic controller using a box as the shell. The controller has a USB 2.0 Type A interface which can plug directly into the Raspberry Pi.
										<br />
										We have also created a website container for future games which can be expanded as required. The development of the container to house the games has not been completed, what we currently have is more a proof-of-concept, however the layout will remain similar if not the same should we have made further progress. This website can be adapted to run off a Node.js server, or it can remain as a simple HTML/CSS website, served directly off the Pi’s filesystem.
										</p>
