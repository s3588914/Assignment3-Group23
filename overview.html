								<h2>Overview</h2>
							</header>
						

						<h3>Topic</h3>
							<div class="para">
								<p>
									Our project idea is to preload a Raspberry Pi with simple programmable games. This game device is marketed towards primary school children, as programming and coding in primary schools is becoming increasingly popular and essential in today's educational society. <br /> <br />
									Our objective is to create a straightforward device to use, so instructors can understand and help kids get started quickly and easily - we want this to be as simple as “Plug and Play”. Built on a Raspberry Pi, it is extremely portable. All the user needs is a monitor with HDMI. <br />

								</p>
							</div>

						<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<div class="para">
								<p>
									<h4>Motivations for this project and why is the project important or interesting?</h4>
									Our main motivation is to encourage students at a primary school age to check out coding and programming earlier on in their education, as different types of development is quickly becoming a highly sought-after skill in the IT industry. It's new to all of us, therefore learning and getting hands on experience with a small computing device, and how to develop a game through programming with Javascript, HTML5 and CSS will definitely be interesting. <br /> <br />
									
									<h4>How does it fit in with current IT trends?</h4>
									Small computing devices like Raspberry Pi computers are a part of a new era of portable, powerful and highly versatile devices. Using a Raspberry Pi in our project allows us to gain knowledge on using a new device for both software and hardware integration. Typically, projects created on Raspberry Pi’s are open-source, and some popular projects also contain documentation on what’s going on, how something works, and in-depth configuration. Learning is easy when there’s a massive community behind a new type of technology.<br /><br />
									
									<h4>What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project?</h4>
									It would show we are a team who can utilise current technologies, interfacing with both software and hardware to create an interactive gaming experience. It would also highlight our ability to adapt to new and dynamic technologies and concepts, as our passion for IT and encouraging our younger generation to get into coding and exploring IT. <br />

						<h3>Landscape</h3>
							<div class="para">
								<p>
									<h4>What similar systems or products are available?</h4>
									While we were unable to find an exact alternative of our planned product, there are various small computing devices in existence which wouldn’t require much alteration to achieve what we are trying to do. Listed below are some alternative small computing devices to the Raspberry Pi: <br /><br />
										<div class="points">
										<ul class="dot">
										<li><a href="https://minnowboard.org/minnowboard-turbot-dual-e/" target="_">MinnowBoard Turbot Dual Ethernet Quad-Core</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://microbit.org/" target="_">BBC micro:bit </a></li>
										<li><a href="http://nextthing.co/pages/chip" target="_">C.H.I.P.</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://www.parallella.org/" target="_">Parallella</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=210" target="_">NanoPC-T3</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.96boards.org/product/hikey960/" target="_">Huawei HiKey 960</a></li>
										</ul>
										</div>

									<h4>What competitors are there?</h4>
									Our major competitor would be the Makey Makey, as this is a product which allows the user to make all sorts of controllers for different applications, using quite literally anything that can conduct a small electric current. They use alligator clips to interface directly into their PCB board. Their product however seems to be more for tinkering and entertainment purposes only, and do not require any programming or coding. <br /><br />
									
									<h4>What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exists now?</h4>
									As of this moment, the closest product as mentioned above is the Makey Makey device, however their product appears to be more for tinkering and entertainment purposes only, and do not require any programming or coding.
									What separates our device from simply purchasing a Raspberry Pi standalone, is ours would come preloaded with Raspbian (the Pi’s OS), and would also include our own open-source game software and API, along with documentation on how to modify and edit the existing games.
									Our product is not a conventional arcade game machine such as “RetroPi”, ours is more of an educational device aimed towards children and early learning.
