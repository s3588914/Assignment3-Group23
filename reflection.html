								<h3>Aaron</h3>
								<div class="para">
								<h4>What went well?</h4>
								<p>I think our group was compatible regarding our interests and knowledge. We each had something to contribute to the team, and got along well. Our group work was done primarily on Google Docs, and we each put effort in to completing the work we assigned each other.</p>
								<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
								<p>Our group’s size in numbers was low, I think we were one of the only groups who had just 3 members. This was not done on purpose, and I don’t think it impeded our ability significantly, however having an extra team member may have helped in some cases.</p>
								<h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
								<p>The number of students present in the last tutorial in comparison to the number of students who came to the presentation (this is not actually surprising).</p>
								<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h4>
								<p>The value of having people with different opinions and strategies, and how that can be extremely positive in various instances.</p>
								</div>

								<h3>Alina</h3>
								<div class="para">
								<h4>What went well?</h4>
								<p>	Overall, I think we did quite well once again for this final assignment. All members of the team participated and contributed in the project. Even though we all had different schedules, everyone make sure to put effort in meeting up to discuss what they were doing and if they needed help with anything. 
									<br /><br />
									Since we did our work on Google Docs, it was easy for everyone to put in their work and keep track of what needed to be done.</p>
								<h4>What could be improved?</h4>
								<p>Besides the number of group members, maybe next time it would be better to meet up more often to do the work together rather than doing most of the work remotely on Google Docs - but really depends on everyone's schedules. </p>
								<h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
								<p>Even though we only had three team members in total, we managed to get quite a bit of work done, however would be nice to have extra team members to share the workload.</p>
								<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h4>
								<p>While working as a team, you become more open-minded to different ideas and learn how to incorporate it together to form a final idea. Also by doing this, it allows you to think differently in comparison to how you usually think and the way you do things.</p>
