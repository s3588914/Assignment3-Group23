									<h2>Team Profile - The Three MuskeTechs</h2>
								</header>
								<h3>Personal Information</h3>
								<div class="para">
								<h4>Aaron</h4>
								<p>My name is Aaron Storey, s3501900 is my student number, and I am part of The Three MuskeTechs. My background is a heavy interest in IT, specifically programming and development. Some hobbies include building and woodworking, I enjoy the process of starting with nothing but an idea, and turning it into a finished product (this applies to physical and digital products). My interest in IT like many kids born in or close to the 90s was apparent in my childhood, but really spiked when I first started learning how to program using PHP when I was 15. My experience with IT started with working as a retail salesperson at a company selling all sorts of technology, and worked my way up to the corporate IT department of said retail company, where I help maintain systems and tools that stores use.</p>
								
								<h4>Alina</h4>
								<p>My name is Alina Nguyen, currently studying Associate Degree of Information Technology - my student number is s3588914. Back when I was in highschool, I focused on the business side of things, especially in Accounting. Unfortunately once I begun studying Business in University, I realised that it wasn’t something that I wanted to have a career in - so while looking for a different field to study, Information Technology caught my interest. Therefore, I decided to give Information Technology a try, and so far my interest has grown. At the moment my experience in IT is very limited, what I have at the moment is what I have gained through my studies at RMIT. 
									</p>
								
								<h4>Joshua</h4>
								<p>My name is Joshua Lawerson, proud member of The Three MuskeTechs. I’ve spent several years working in advocacy and have come to a point now where I’m looking for a career change. I used to fence competitively and still enjoy the sport recreationally. I’m a  deeply competitive person and think that this would transition well into the IT field. My experience in IT so far has been limited to things that I’ve taught myself, largely revolving around working with excel. My interest in IT has changed as I’ve grown, starting with an obsession with any video game I could get my hands on to now throwing myself into every programming language I have the opportunity to study.</p>

							<h3>Group Processes</h3>
							<div class="para">
								<h4>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h4>
								<p>Our group overall worked really well together, we were able to delegate tasks to each team member based on their strengths quite easily without any issues - also providing help to one another when needed. As a group we also came to a decision on what to do for our final project idea quite quickly, as it contains elements from each of our project ideas from Assignment 1.
									</p>
								<h4>Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</h4>
								<p>We will be utilizing GitHub in more depth as a method to store and share documentation between each group member. While we did this in our last Assignment, we will be doing this with a larger number of resources and files.
									We will also ensure to create our report as a single PDF file as intended in the assignment brief, as our last assignment we instead included our report as a part of the group’s website. </p>
