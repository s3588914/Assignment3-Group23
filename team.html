									<h2>Team Profile - The Three MuskeTechs</h2>
								</header>
								<h3>Personal Information</h3>
								<div class="para">
								<img src="images/aaron.jpg" alt="" width="30%" height="30%" >
								<h4>Aaron</h4>
								<p>My name is Aaron Storey, s3501900 is my student number, and I am part of The Three MuskeTechs. My background is a heavy interest in IT, specifically programming and development. Some hobbies include building and woodworking, I enjoy the process of starting with nothing but an idea, and turning it into a finished product (this applies to physical and digital products). My interest in IT like many kids born in or close to the 90s was apparent in my childhood, but really spiked when I first started learning how to program using PHP when I was 15. My experience with IT started with working as a retail salesperson at a company selling all sorts of technology, and worked my way up to the corporate IT department of said retail company, where I help maintain systems and tools that stores use.</p>
								<br />
								<img src="images/alina.jpg" alt="" width="30%" height="30%" >
								<h4>Alina</h4>
								<p>My name is Alina Nguyen, currently studying Associate Degree of Information Technology - my student number is s3588914. Back when I was in highschool, I focused on the business side of things, especially in Accounting. Unfortunately once I begun studying Business in University, I realised that it wasn’t something that I wanted to have a career in - so while looking for a different field to study, Information Technology caught my interest. Therefore, I decided to give Information Technology a try, and so far my interest has grown. At the moment my experience in IT is very limited, what I have at the moment is what I have gained through my studies at RMIT. </p>
								<br />
								<img src="images/josh.jpg" alt="" width="30%" height="30%" >
								<h4>Joshua</h4>
								<p>My name is Joshua Lawerson, proud member of The Three MuskeTechs. I’ve spent several years working in advocacy and have come to a point now where I’m looking for a career change. I used to fence competitively and still enjoy the sport recreationally. I’m a  deeply competitive person and think that this would transition well into the IT field. My experience in IT so far has been limited to things that I’ve taught myself, largely revolving around working with excel. My interest in IT has changed as I’ve grown, starting with an obsession with any video game I could get my hands on to now throwing myself into every programming language I have the opportunity to study.</p>

							<h3>Group Processes</h3>
							<div class="para">
								<h4>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h4>
								<p>Our group overall worked really well together, we were able to delegate tasks to each team member based on their strengths quite easily without any issues - also providing help to one another when needed. As a group we also came to a decision on what to do for our final project idea quite quickly, as it contains elements from each of our project ideas from Assignment 1.
									</p>
								<h4>Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</h4>
								<p>We will be utilizing GitHub in more depth as a method to store and share documentation between each group member. While we did this in our last Assignment, we will be doing this with a larger number of resources and files.
									We will also ensure to create our report as a single PDF file as intended in the assignment brief, as our last assignment we instead included our report as a part of the group’s website. </p>
							</div>
							<h3>Career Plans</h3>
							<div class="para">
									<h4>What common elements are there, if any?</h4>
								<p>It’s difficult to point out job-specific skills here, as these can and will change drastically in a short amount of time. Instead, we’ve decided to dot-point interpersonal elements which would be required for all 3 jobs. 
									
									<div class="points">
									<ul class="dot">	
										<li>Adaptability/Dynamic</li>
										<li>Communication skills</li>
										<li>Able to be a part of a team</li>
										<li>Able to embrace change</li>
										<li>Keep up to date with new trends and standards</li>
										<li>Organised</li>
										<li>Planning skills/Time Management</li>
										<li>Eye for detail</li>
									</ul>
									</div>
									</p>

										<h4>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h4>
										<p>
												All 3 jobs are similar in many ways, and as above, without going into too much job-specific detail, noted down are some elements which make each job unique in comparison to the others.

												<div class="points">
													<h4>Full-Stack Developer</h4>
												<ul class="dot">
												<li>Broad and quality knowledge on both front-end and back-end design and implementation </li>
												<li>No specific expertise on one particular development technology</li>
												</ul>

													<h4>Web Developer</h4>
												<ul class="dot">
												<li>Focus on design and creativity</li>
												</ul>

													<h4>Penetration Tester</h4>
												<ul class="dot">
												<li>Focus on testing and finding security issues/vulnerability </li>
												</ul>	

												</div>
										</p>
										<p>
											<h4>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h4>
											All 3 career plans are based in core parts of IT, and are fundamental to any business IT solution, however the path and prerequisites slightly differ in terms of experience required. <br/><br/>
											<div class="points">
													<h4>Full-Stack Developer</h4>
													To get a job as a full-stack developer, you would need a long and experienced history, working in different fields of software and web development. This is not a job you would typically receive as your first role. <br/> <br/>

													<h4>Web Developer</h4>
													To get a job as a web developer, you would need some sort of portfolio to demonstrate and show your previous works, professional or casual, along with displaying an eye for design and understanding of current technologies.<br/><br/>
												
													<h4>Penetration Tester</h4>
													To get a job as a security penetration tester, you would require a vast knowledge of computer operating systems, IT infrastructure, common company practices, how to expose vulnerabilities, and how to then exploit said weaknesses. You would also have to show some level of ethics, to demonstrate to a potential employer that you’re not in the business for malicious intent, but rather to protect and prevent.<br/><br/>
											</div>
											All 3 jobs all share the same basic elements which many jobs in and outside of IT require, such as communication skills, punctuality, eye for detail and adaptability. They also all require some form of experience, although web-development is one which out of the 3 would require the least formal experience.
