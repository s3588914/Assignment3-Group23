											<h2>Aims</h2>
										</header>
										<div class="para">
										<h4>Specific Aim</h4>
										Our overall aim for this project is to design and create a fully functional programmable arcade game developer device that runs off a Raspberry Pi. Also to have a working product complete with an external arcade-style controller to interface directly with the game. The Raspberry Pi and game controller together will allow an end-user to plug straight into a TV or Monitor, power on the Pi, and have the game menu screen auto-launch to begin paying a game in the browser.
										<br /><br />
										<h4>Smaller Goals</h4>
										How do we achieve our aim?  Below are some paragraphs which outline and detail what is required to reach our aim.
										<br /><br />
										First and foremost, we need to ascertain a Raspberry Pi, Micro SD card with adapter, and the parts required for constructing a simple joystick and button controller. Josh has taken charge of designing, ordering parts, and constructing the game controller, while Aaron has purchased a Raspberry Pi Model B3+.
										<br /><br />
										Our next goal is to research the software and operating system required to install on to the Micro SD card for the Raspberry Pi to run. There are many different kinds out there, however actually installing the OS has been made very simple thanks to many guides and tools.
										Alongside this, we need to investigate more on our preference of HTML5/JS library called Phaser, and begin learning how to construct a basic game using their framework.
										<br /><br />
										After ensuring the OS is installed on the Pi, we can then begin programming a basic starter game to learn how the language works. Getting a basic sample game created will allow us to continue to work on and develop our understanding of how the library works, what is possible, how to best structure elements of the source, how to best run the game in the browser and how to allow for expansion and modification.
										<br /><br />
										After developing a working prototype, the next goal would be to find an investor to fund our project further, and bring on additional professionals to assist in marketing and further developing our product.
										<br /><br />
										After working with a professional developer and technical lead, the source code of the game should be complete, and the question of how it will be run in the browser should be discovered. The next mission will be to develop a solid and concise set of documentation on the games we have created. 
										<br /><br />
										Testing our product will be essential, using contracted testers and QA professionals, we will go through our product, identify any issues, ranging anywhere from how easy the unit it to “Plug and play”, or any problems with the games themselves, or any issues with modifying or coding your own game. All issues raised will be prioritized, and fixed accordingly before release.
										<br /><br />
										Marketing and advertising our product will be the last step while working closely with real end-users as testers. We will need to get in touch with various organisations who educate or teach kids, and reach out in hopes to run informative demonstration sessions, in a bid to raise interest.
										<br /><br />
										Full release will only be done when the product is stable for an initial release, some minor bugs or issues are tolerable so long as they do not inhibit or seriously affect the user’s experience. There will never be a final stage to this project, as it will be constantly updated, transformed/upgraded, and expanded upon.
										<br /><br />
										<h4>What are the most important parts of the project?</h4>
										There are multiple milestones in this project.
										<br />
										The first major milestone, was to research and learn about a suitable language to begin programming a game in, in this case we selected and began researching the HTML5/JS language called Phaser.
										<br /><br />
										The second major milestone was actually purchasing and receiving the hardware components required - as we knew whatever we ended up deciding for programming would inevitably run on a physical device, so this has become an important task.
										<br /><br />
										Other important tasks such as installing and configuring a Raspberry Pi (assuming at this point we had received the Pi), along with building a game controller, were also required to allow us to build a working prototype for the Raspberry Pi for testing and further development.
										<br /><br />
										<h4>Which parts should have priority over the others?</h4>
											<div class="points">
											<br />
											- Creating at least one game, as we should be able to at least provide a proof-of-concept.
											<br /><br />
											- Installing the Raspberry Pi’s OS, as this will allow us to begin building and testing the game on the Pi itself.
											<br /><br />
											- Construct a game controller, as we can then expand development to support an external game controller.
											<br /><br />
											- Further configuration of Raspberry Pi, to set things such as auto-run game upon boot, setup proper directory structure and source code comments.
											</div>
											<br /><br />
											<h4>If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which should it be?</h4>
											<br />
											Developing at least one game which can function to the point of being somewhat playable and modifiable.
